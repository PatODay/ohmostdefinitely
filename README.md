# Oh, Most Definitely Bot

[View the bot on Twitter, @ODefinitely](https://twitter.com/ODefinitely)

This is an automated Twitter bot I made after remembering and being inspired by the Twitter account known as [@StealthMountain](https://twitter.com/StealthMountain).

##### Current Features

This app will reply to any Twitter user who uses the word `defiantly` with `I think you mean 'definitely'` because 99 times out of 100 they mean to use `definitely`.

# Development Process

This idea went from conception to development fairly quickly once I had read some materials about how simple it is to make a Twitter Bot. While it was simple to make a basic bot, it took some time and reading to get the finished product on this. I had to refine my code and figure out how to get the app to search for the keyword and reply to the tweet containing it instead of creating a new tweet and sending it to the user who had tweeted with the keyword out of context.

I really enjoyed working with Node and Heroku on this project. I hope to make another bot which will incorporate third-party API's and shares the data it scrapes from those (likely something sports related).
